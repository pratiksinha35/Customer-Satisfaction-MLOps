# MLOps End-to-End Project Setup

## Overview

This project is an exercise in setting up an end-to-end MLOps pipeline, focusing on the deployment aspect. MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) integrates the principles of DevOps in the machine learning lifecycle to automate and streamline workflows, from data preprocessing to model deployment and monitoring.

## Key Components

1. **ZenML**: A MLOps framework to create reproducible, maintainable, and modular pipelines for machine learning projects.
2. **MLflow**: An open-source platform to manage the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your MLOps pipeline using ZenML and MLflow:

### 1. Install MLflow Integration

First, install the MLflow integration with ZenML:
```bash
zenml integration install mlflow -y
```

### 2. Register MLflow as the Experiment Tracker

Register MLflow as the experiment tracker in ZenML:
```bash
zenml experiment-tracker register mlflow_tracker --flavor=mlflow
```

### 3. Register MLflow as the Model Deployer

Register MLflow as the model deployer in ZenML:
```bash
zenml model-deployer register mlflow --flavor=mlflow
```

### 4. Create and Set the ZenML Stack

Create a ZenML stack that uses the default artifact store, the default orchestrator, and MLflow for both experiment tracking and model deployment:
```bash
zenml stack register mlflow_stack -a default -o default -d mlflow -e mlflow_tracker --set
```

## Explanation

### ZenML Integrations

- `zenml integration install mlflow -y`: This command installs the MLflow integration within ZenML. The `-y` flag automatically confirms the installation.

### Experiment Tracking

- `zenml experiment-tracker register mlflow_tracker --flavor=mlflow`: This command registers MLflow as the experiment tracker in ZenML. An experiment tracker helps in tracking and comparing different runs of machine learning experiments.

### Model Deployment

- `zenml model-deployer register mlflow --flavor=mlflow`: This command registers MLflow as the model deployer. The model deployer component in ZenML is responsible for deploying trained models to a production environment.

### Stack Creation

- `zenml stack register mlflow_stack -a default -o default -d mlflow -e mlflow_tracker --set`: This command creates and sets a ZenML stack named `mlflow_stack`. A stack in ZenML is a combination of various components that define the end-to-end MLOps pipeline. In this case:
  - `-a default`: Uses the default artifact store.
  - `-o default`: Uses the default orchestrator.
  - `-d mlflow`: Specifies MLflow as the model deployer.
  - `-e mlflow_tracker`: Specifies MLflow as the experiment tracker.

## Focus on Deployment

While this project covers the entire MLOps pipeline, it places special emphasis on the deployment part. By leveraging MLflow's capabilities for model deployment, we ensure that the transition from model training to production is smooth and reliable. This setup allows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) of machine learning models, which is crucial for maintaining robust and scalable machine learning systems.

## Conclusion

By following the above steps, you will have set up a basic end-to-end MLOps pipeline with a strong focus on deployment using ZenML and MLflow. This setup serves as a foundation for more complex and scalable MLOps workflows, ensuring reproducibility, maintainability, and efficiency in your machine learning projects.
